HereIsWally is a Tensorflow project that includes a model for solving Where's Wally puzzles.
It uses Faster RCNN Inception v2 model initially trained on COCO dataset and retrained for finding Wally using transfer learning with Tensorflow Object Detection API.

## Getting Ready
1. Install latest version of Tensorflow
2. Follow [Tensorflow Object Detection Installation instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md) (optional)

## Usage
```
python find_wally_pretty.py
```
or
```
python find_wally.py
```

One of the images from the eval folder should pop up with wally outlined

## Requirements
- [Python 3.5+](https://www.continuum.io/download)
- [TensorFlow 1.3](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

## Sources
- [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection)
